The Solo-Traveller Handbook was created by the developer, Nafeesah Younis, to serve the solo travelling community. I belong to many Facebook communities geared specifically towards women who like to travel solo & often when you look at sites like TripAdvisor and you search for activities geared towards people who travel solo, it takes quite a bit of filtering to find what you need.

I felt that it would be a good idea to create a database where all of the recommendations made by the solo-travelling community were in one place, hence the birth of the solo-traveller-handbook.

# UX

## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The target audience for the Solo-Traveller-Handbook is 18+, English-speaking adults with a decent grasp of technology. Primarily the site is aimed at solo-travellers, but can be used by anyone who is travelling and looking for an additional resource to help them plan their trip.

The user goals are:

- To have a database where they can quickly search for things to do in a new city.

- To be able to create a record of places they've visited and enjoyed, and share it with others.

- To contribute to a growing global solo-traveller community.

The Solo-Traveller Handbook is a great way to meet these needs because:

- Currently travel sites like TripAdvisor are catered towards all travellers, and it requires a lot of filtering to find things just for solo-travellers.

- A lot of sites have recommendations made my tourists instead of seasoned travellers and locals. The Create Activity function allows locals to also share gems from their home cities.

- The design of the site is very simple and functional.

- At the moment users can search by city, category and name. In future, I hope to expand those filters but this was not possible within the timeframe allotted for this project.

### Business Goals

The target businesses for this site are both small and big business owners. They can use the site to recommend their restaurants, experiences etc to other travellers. 

### Business User Goals

Business user goals are:

- A functional, clean and appealing-to-the eye site upon which I can advertise my business.

- The ability to easily and efficiently add data about my services.

- For the end user to easily be able to find my listings through searching via the city and/or the category.

The Solo-Traveller-Handbook currently caters towards those needs in the following ways:

- Due to its easy-to-use interface and simple form layout, businesses can easily create an account and start creating listings immediately.

- Listings created by a business are automatically and immediately added to the global database, so potential clients can see the business straight away when they search.

- The 'Manage my Listings' page allows the business to go back to any listings he or she has created and make edits at any time, or delete. 

- Navigation buttons are placed on every page, so it is easy for the business user to quickly and efficiently achieve their goals.

### Solo-Traveller-Handbook Goals

- To provide a clean, clear site where solo-travellers can access recommendations made by locals, small business owners and other solo-travellers.

- As a developer, I wanted to practice combining Front-end & Backend languages and this is my first project doing so. I wanted to experiment with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript combined with Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja.

- Although this is a student project, in the future I would like to expand the filters and potentially create a space that can be used by the solo-travel Facebook communities I am a part of to consolidate all of the information that is shared.

## User Stories

As someone who is visiting the Solo-Traveller-Handbook, I want to:

## Design Choices

The Solo-Traveller-Handbook has an overall feeling of adventure and exploration. This is in order to inspire the users of the site to travel and contribute to the handbook.

### Fonts

- The font 'Arimo', sans-serif' was used for the main content of the site, because I felt that it was very clear and bold without detracting too much from the overall design. It is also easy to read on smaller screen sizes.

- The font 'Shadows Into Light', cursive; has been used for the headers throughout the site, as I felt that it gave a fun, adventurous feel to the titles and fit nicely with the hero images. 

### Hero images

    <img src="/static/images/hero-images.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="Image of how home page looks on all screen sizes" aria-label="Image of how home page looks on all screen sizes" />
</div>

The following three hero images/illustrations were chosen for the Home, Search & Add Activity Pages respectively. These three images were chosen as they immediately draw the eye of the user, and therefore enhance the user experience.

I opted for illustrations instead of photographs as I felt that they gave the site a more individual feel and a more distinctive brand.

- The Hero Image for the index page (the solo traveller looking out at a landscape) was selected because it evoked a sense of adventure and mystery. I felt that from a design perspective it captured the essence of the site.

- The Hero Image for the Search Page (the person on the motorcycle) was chosen firstly because it aligned with the colour scheme, and secondly because the illustration matched the theme of the main page image. It also aligned with the idea of an activity that you'd do while travelling, and therefore created a visual image of 'discovering things to do on holiday'.

- The Hero Image for the Create Page was selected because of its aesthetic value and how it visually fit in with the theme. I also felt that the colour scheme creates an inspiring feeling, which would make users want to create and contribute to the site.
