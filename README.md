# Data Centric Project
## Solo-Traveller-Handbook

[Heroku App](https://solo-travel-handbook.herokuapp.com/)

The Solo-Traveller Handbook was created by the developer, Nafeesah Younis, to serve the solo travelling community. I belong to many Facebook communities geared specifically towards women who like to travel solo & often when you look at sites like TripAdvisor and you search for activities geared towards people who travel solo, it takes quite a bit of filtering to find what you need.

I felt that it would be a good idea to create a database where all of the recommendations made by the solo-travelling community were in one place, hence the birth of the solo-traveller-handbook.

## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The target audience for the Solo-Traveller-Handbook is 18+, English-speaking adults with a decent grasp of technology. Primarily the site is aimed at solo-travellers, but can be used by anyone who is travelling and looking for an additional resource to help them plan their trip.

The user goals are:

- To have a database where they can quickly search for things to do in a new city.

- To be able to create a record of places they've visited and enjoyed, and share it with others.

- To contribute to a growing global solo-traveller community.

The Solo-Traveller Handbook is a great way to meet these needs because:

- Currently travel sites like TripAdvisor are catered towards all travellers, and it requires a lot of filtering to find things just for solo-travellers.

- A lot of sites have recommendations made my tourists instead of seasoned travellers and locals. The Create Activity function allows locals to also share gems from their home cities.

- The design of the site is very simple and functional.

- At the moment users can search by city, category and name. In future, I hope to expand those filters but this was not possible within the timeframe allotted for this project.

### Business Goals

The target businesses for this site are both small and big business owners. They can use the site to recommend their restaurants, experiences etc to other travellers.
