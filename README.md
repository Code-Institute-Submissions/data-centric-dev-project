## Solo-Traveller-Handbook

[Heroku App](https://solo-travel-handbook.herokuapp.com/)

The Solo-Traveller Handbook was created by the developer, Nafeesah Younis, to serve the solo travelling community. I belong to many Facebook communities geared specifically towards women who like to travel solo & often when you look at sites like TripAdvisor and you search for activities geared towards people who travel solo, it takes quite a bit of filtering to find what you need.

I felt that it would be a good idea to create a database where all of the recommendations made by the solo-travelling community were in one place, hence the birth of the solo-traveller-handbook.
